    Dear Thea,

    This is my first ever letter I‚Äôve made to someone so I hope you understand. 
    
    First of all, I just wanna say that I‚Äôm really grateful that I had a friend like you, we‚Äôve known each other, spent some time together for almost 4 years. To be honest, I really didn‚Äôt expect that someone like you can keep up with my weirdness, silliness and any random things that I have. 
    Thank you also for opening up to me sometimes it really means a lot to me, I guess that‚Äôs one of the reasons why I like you. 
    
    Yes bae, I know I‚Äôve already confessed to you before but i‚Äôll say it again anyways in case you forgot, I LIKE YOU. And it‚Äôs not just the fact that I like you, I WANT YOU. 
    
    I really enjoy your presence, your company, your vibes, and everything. You‚Äôre not just filled with beauty but you‚Äôre also smart, caring, hardworking, and has a lot of dream. I‚Äôm sorry for being in denial about my feelings at first, but right now I‚Äôm ready to make these things clear to you. 
    
    And lastly, even though you have a change of heart, I just wanna say that I really do appreciate your feelings towards me, even though I know you have high standards, I still don‚Äôt know what you saw in a guy like me. There‚Äôs still some few things I wanna say to you but I‚Äôm afraid this might become an essay instead of a simple letter so I won‚Äôt prolong this any further.
    
    As I end this letter, I know I‚Äôve said that there‚Äôs no pressure or anything but at the same time, I just can‚Äôt help but to think that time is also ticking. So, I‚Äôm ready to ask you that one and final question that‚Äôs been on my mind lately.
